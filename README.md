# Rocket-launch-Stykz
This is a simple Animation project which I did for my Graphics and Multimedia lab during my Undergraduate career. This project shows the lifecycle of a Rocket from its launch in Earth, the travel through space and finally its successful landing on the moon.
It is done using the software Stykz.
